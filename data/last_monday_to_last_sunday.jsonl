By integrating action modules into these\npretrained models, VLA methods exhibit improved generalization. However,\ntraining them from scratch is costly. In this work, we propose a simple yet\neffective distillation-based framework that equips VLMs with action-execution\ncapability by transferring knowledge from pretrained small action models. Our\narchitecture retains the original VLM structure, adding only an action token\nand a state encoder to incorporate physical inputs. To distill action\nknowledge, we adopt a two-stage training strategy. First, we perform\nlightweight alignment by mapping VLM hidden states into the action space of the\nsmall action model, enabling effective reuse of its pretrained action decoder\nand avoiding expensive pretraining. Second, we selectively fine-tune the\nlanguage model, state encoder, and action modules, enabling the system to\nintegrate multimodal inputs with precise action generation. Specifically, the\naction token provides the VLM with a direct handle for predicting future\nactions, while the state encoder allows the model to incorporate robot dynamics\nnot captured by vision alone. This design yields substantial efficiency gains\nover training large VLA models from scratch.

This paper\naims to advance all-scale spatial reasoning across diverse scenarios by\ntackling two key challenges: 1) the heavy reliance on indoor 3D scans and\nlabor-intensive manual annotations for dataset curation; 2) the absence of\neffective all-scale scene modeling, which often leads to overfitting to\nindividual scenes. In this paper, we introduce a holistic solution that\nintegrates a structured spatial reasoning knowledge system, scale-aware\nmodeling, and a progressive training paradigm, as the first attempt to broaden\nthe all-scale spatial intelligence of MLLMs to the best of our knowledge. Using\na task-specific, specialist-driven automated pipeline, we curate over 38K video\nscenes across 5 spatial scales to create SpaceVista-1M, a dataset comprising\napproximately 1M spatial QA pairs spanning 19 diverse task types. While\nspecialist models can inject useful domain knowledge, they are not reliable for\nevaluation. We then build an all-scale benchmark with precise annotations by\nmanually recording, retrieving, and assembling video-based data. However, naive\ntraining with SpaceVista-1M often yields suboptimal results due to the\npotential knowledge conflict.

Motivated by this\ninsight, we introduce CapGeo, a caption-assisted reasoning framework that\nbridges visual and textual modalities. Experiments show substantial\nimprovements when models are equipped with captions: Qwen2.5-VL-72B improves\nfrom 8.6% (vision-only) to 59.0%, while Claude-Opus-4 rises from 44.8% to\n73.0%. To systematically evaluate and identify high-quality geometric\ncaptioning models, we further propose CapGeo-Bench, a dataset of 4,641 curated\nfigure-caption pairs. Crucially, CapGeo-Bench incorporates a keypoint-based\nevaluation metric that correlates strongly with downstream CapGeo performance,\nenabling reliable assessment of geometric captioning ability.

In this paper, we undertake a pioneering\nexploration of multimodal RLVR through the novel perspective of token\nperception, which measures the visual dependency of each generated token. With\na granular analysis of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) processes, we uncover two key\ninsights: first, token perception in a rollout trajectory is sparsely\ndistributed, where only a small fraction of tokens have high visual dependency\nfor visually-grounded reasoning; second, different trajectories exhibit\nsignificant divergence in their overall visual dependency. Based on these\nobservations, we propose Visually-Perceptive Policy Optimization (VPPO), a\nnovel policy gradient algorithm that explicitly leverages token perception to\nrefine the learning signal. Specifically, VPPO achieves this through a dual\nmechanism: it reweights a trajectory's advantage by its overall visual\ndependency, and focuses policy updates exclusively on perceptually pivotal\ntokens. On a comprehensive suite of eight perception and reasoning benchmarks,\nVPPO demonstrates substantial gains over leading open-source RL-tuned models,\nwith its effectiveness consistently validated across 7B and 32B model scales.\nOur findings not only establish a new token-level perceptual perspective for\nanalyzing multimodal RLVR but also present a novel and effective optimization\nstrategy to significantly enhance the multimodal reasoning capabilities of\nLVLMs.", "authors": ["Siyuan Huang", "Xiaoye Qu", "Yafu Li", "Yun Luo", "Zefeng He", "Daizong Liu", "Yu Cheng"], "categories": ["cs.CV"], "published": "2025-10-10T11:25:33Z", "pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.09285v1", "abs": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09285v1", "comment": "31 pages, 10 figures, project page:\n  https://github.com/huaixuheqing/VPPO-RL"}

In this work, we reveal a more practical threat: attackers\ncan manipulate VLAs by simply injecting physical objects as triggers into the\ntraining dataset. We propose goal-oriented backdoor attacks (GoBA), where the\nVLA behaves normally in the absence of physical triggers but executes\npredefined and goal-oriented actions in the presence of physical triggers.\nSpecifically, based on a popular VLA benchmark LIBERO, we introduce BadLIBERO\nthat incorporates diverse physical triggers and goal-oriented backdoor actions.\nIn addition, we propose a three-level evaluation that categorizes the victim\nVLA's actions under GoBA into three states: nothing to do, try to do, and\nsuccess to do.
